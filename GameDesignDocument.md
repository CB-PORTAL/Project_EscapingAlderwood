## Game Overview <a name="game-overview"></a>

"Escaping Alderwood: Chapter One - The Cry Heard Through Alderwood," plunges players into the cold heart of the English witch trials of 1592, as they strive to navigate the spectral and psychological horrors of survival. Within the oppressive confines of Alderwood, a village consumed by fear and superstition, players become Mabel, a young mother unjustly accused of witchcraft, fighting not only for her life but for the safety of her innocent infant son, Thomas.

As Mabel, players awaken in the dank, gloom-ridden Alderwood jail, the chilling sound of Thomas' whimpering echoing against the stone walls. Each shuffling footstep, each whispering wind, a stark reminder of the terror that awaits. With execution imminent, Mabel must negotiate the treacherous path of escape, facing the horrors that skulk in Alderwood's shadows and the deadly stake-burning that promises a gruesome end.

The game turns a journey through the claustrophobic streets of Alderwood into an eerie symphony of survival horror. The air grows denser, the whispers of spectral entities curl around corners, and the villagers' eyes glow with a malicious intent. They lurk in wait for the young witch and her child, driven by a deadly combination of fear, hatred, and misguided righteousness.

"Escaping Alderwood: Chapter One - The Cry Heard Through Alderwood," adds a terrifying urgency to Mabel's mission - a countdown timer representing baby Thomas' restlessness. Once the timer depletes, Thomas' cries echo through the village, potentially alerting the ever-watchful villagers and the vengeful spectral entities. The threat of exposure pushes Mabel's stealth and courage to their limits, forcing players to think quickly and tread softly.

The historically authentic environment, created with Unreal Engine, paints a haunting image of Alderwood's relentless cruelty. Detailed 3D models of characters and key items, crafted with Blender, instill a tangible sense of dread, making the gaming experience gruesomely palpable.

This chapter is not merely a game; it is an immersive dive into the darkest chapters of history, where the lines between humanity and monstrosity blur. It invites players to endure a chilling, survival horror experience that will leave them questioning their courage, their sanity, and their resolve.

Prepare to face your fears. The journey through Alderwood awaits, fraught with terror and suspense. Will you escape, or will the chilling specter of death claim you? In the shadowed corners of Alderwood, only the brave survive.
