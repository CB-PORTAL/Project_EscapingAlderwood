## Game Overview <a name="game-overview"></a>

"Escaping Alderwood: Chapter One - The Cry Heard Around Alderwood," plunges players into the cold heart of the English witch trials of 1592, as they strive to navigate the spectral and psychological horrors of survival. Within the oppressive confines of Alderwood, a village consumed by fear and superstition, players become Mabel, a young mother unjustly accused of witchcraft, fighting not only for her life but for the safety of her innocent infant son, Thomas.

As Mabel, players awaken in the dank, gloom-ridden Alderwood jail, the chilling sound of Thomas' whimpering echoing against the stone walls. Each shuffling footstep, each whispering wind, a stark reminder of the terror that awaits. With execution imminent, Mabel must negotiate the treacherous path of escape, facing the horrors that skulk in Alderwood's shadows and the deadly stake-burning that promises a gruesome end.

The game turns a journey through the claustrophobic streets of Alderwood into an eerie symphony of survival horror. The air grows denser, the whispers of spectral entities curl around corners, and the villagers' eyes glow with a malicious intent. They lurk in wait for the young witch and her child, driven by a deadly combination of fear, hatred, and misguided righteousness.

"Escaping Alderwood: Chapter One - The Cry Heard Through Alderwood," adds a terrifying urgency to Mabel's mission - a countdown timer representing baby Thomas' restlessness. Once the timer depletes, Thomas' cries echo through the village, potentially alerting the ever-watchful villagers and the vengeful spectral entities. The threat of exposure pushes Mabel's stealth and courage to their limits, forcing players to think quickly and tread softly.

The historically authentic environment, created with Unreal Engine, paints a haunting image of Alderwood's relentless cruelty. Detailed 3D models of characters and key items, crafted with Blender, instill a tangible sense of dread, making the gaming experience gruesomely palpable.

## Game Mechanics <a name="game-mechanics"></a>

Immersing you into the heart of the English witch trials of 1592, "Escaping Alderwood: Chapter One - The Cry Heard Through Alderwood," utilizes a collection of sophisticated game mechanics that bring the chilling narrative to life. As Mabel, a mother falsely accused of witchcraft, players must employ their wits and courage to navigate through Alderwood's perilous environment, evading its superstitious residents and the haunting spectral entities lurking in the village's shadowy corners.

The game utilizes a first-person perspective, providing an intimate connection to Mabel and her dire situation. Moving through Alderwood involves a combination of keyboard and mouse controls, with the WASD keys controlling movement and the mouse guiding Mabel's line of sight. Players must maneuver through the oppressive streets, using the stealth mechanic (crouch - Left CTRL, prone - Z) to avoid detection by the villagers and spectral entities. 

An intriguing puzzle-solving element enhances the gameplay, challenging players to crack riddles steeped in 16th-century folklore and uncover hidden clues in the environment. Interaction with the game world is facilitated through the mouse's left-click function for picking up items or performing actions and the right-click for examining objects closely.

Central to the gameplay is a unique mechanic - a countdown timer symbolizing baby Thomas's restlessness. As this timer depletes, Mabel's objective becomes increasingly critical. Once the timer runs out, the silence shatters with Thomas's cries (Soothe - E key), alerting the villagers and the supernatural entities. Managing this countdown becomes crucial to maintain stealth and continue Mabel's desperate quest for freedom.

A resource management mechanic further heightens the game's tension. Players can use the TAB key to access Mabel's satchel, where a variety of crucial items can be stored and used strategically. From protective amulets to healing herbs, each item has its function and is assigned to hotkeys 1-5 for easy access during tense situations. This mechanic requires players to make careful decisions about which resources to keep, use, or discard as they traverse the hauntingly detailed environments crafted with Unreal Engine.

In "Escaping Alderwood: Chapter One," players must also maintain a delicate balance between survival and motherhood, each decision carrying weight. From evading hostile villagers and performing protective rites (Spellcasting - F key) to attending to Thomas's needs, your choices can mean life or death in this ruthless environment where even the smallest sound can draw unwanted attention.

Whether played via a mouse and keyboard or a traditional game controller, "Escaping Alderwood: Chapter One" provides a deep, immersive experience. Its intuitive controls, combined with complex survival mechanics, creates a tension-filled journey through history's darker chapters. Your survival depends on your ability to navigate this intricate maze of fear and suspicion. Can you withstand the spectral horrors and guide Mabel and Thomas safely out of Alderwood? Only the shadows know.
