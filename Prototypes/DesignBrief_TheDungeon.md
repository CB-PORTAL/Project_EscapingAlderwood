## Game Design Brief

---

### Game Title: 
"Escaping Alderwood: The Dungeon Prototype"

### Game Type: 
2D Puzzle Adventure - Game Mechanics Prototype

### Platform: 
Android (Google Play Store)

---

### Objective:

The player takes on the role of Mabel, a desperate mother in 16th-century Alderwood, England. Trapped in a dungeon during the infamous witch trials of 1592, Mabel must locate and rescue her captive son, Thomas. As the game progresses, the rescue mission intensifies, with guards continuously relocating Thomas. Mabel has three lives; if captured three times, the game ends in failure.

### Game Prototype Scope:

This prototype focuses on the first level, "The Dungeon," showcasing the core mechanics for the Android version developed in Unity. Future stages will include "The Courtyard," "The Village," and "The Forest," with the main antagonist, Constable Harrow, in the final face-off.

### Game Mechanics:

1. **Orientation and Sound Indication:** Thomas's crying guides Mabel, varying in intensity depending on her proximity to him.
2. **Guard Encounters:** Consequences differ if guards touch Mabel before or after rescuing Thomas.
3. **Life System:** Mabel has 3 lives, and losing them all ends the game.
4. **Dagger Pick-up:** Mabel's primary tool for offense and defense.
5. **Baby Thomas as a Shield:** Thomas serves as a shield after rescue, allowing Mabel to fight back.
6. **Maze Navigation:** Mastery of the dungeon maze is vital to success.

### Levels:

1. **Level 1: The Dungeon** - Mabel's escape saga begins here, testing navigational skills and strategy.
   * Future Levels: **Level 2: The Courtyard**, **Level 3: The Village**, **Level 4: The Forest** - Details TBA.

### Aesthetics:

Adopting a retro 2D style, the art direction reflects the historical grimness of Alderwood during the witch trials, with bleak and threatening dungeon aesthetics.

---

### Sound Design:

Sound plays a key role, with Thomas's crying as the primary guide, atmospheric dungeon sounds, and a suspenseful soundtrack.

---

### Target Audience:

Aimed at players aged 13 and up, the game offers strategic problem-solving and mild violence, suitable for the targeted age group.

---

### Technical Requirements:

Developed in Unity specifically for Android, the game must be optimized for various Android devices on the Play Store. Future prototypes may include versions for VR, Steam, Windows, and iOS. The focus of this brief is on delivering the desired visuals, mechanics, and performance for the Android Play Store version.
