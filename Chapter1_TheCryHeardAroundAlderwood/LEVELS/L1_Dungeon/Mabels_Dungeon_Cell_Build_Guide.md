# Building and Decorating Mabel's Dungeon Cell

Follow these steps to create a convincing and atmospheric dungeon cell:

1. Drag "**Floor01**", the cold, hard stone floor of the dungeon, into the scene.
2. Resize "Floor01" to 4x4 meters to serve as the base of the cell. This uneven and pitted surface has been worn smooth by the countless prisoners who have trodden it before.
3. Position "Floor01" at the center of the scene.
4. Drag "**Wall01**", the cold, damp stone wall scarred with the desperate etchings of countless forgotten souls, into the scene.
5. Resize "Wall01" to a height of 3 meters, its oppressive presence establishing the cell's boundaries.
6. Position "Wall01" along one edge of "Floor01."
7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for "Wall02", another representation of despair hewn in stone.
8. Drag "**Door01**", a thick, worm-eaten wooden door, into the scene.
9. Resize "Door01" to fit within the wall, its heavy bolts emphasizing the inescapability of the cell.
10. Position "Door01" on one of the cell walls.
11. Drag "**Ceiling01**", a hanging oppressively low, stone ceiling with stalactites hinting at the dungeon's age and disrepair, into the scene.
12. Resize "Ceiling01" to cover the cell.
13. Position "Ceiling01" above the walls, its ominous presence pressing down on the cell.
14. In the "Material Editor", find the texture "StoneWet01".
15. Apply "StoneWet01" to "Floor01", "Wall01", "Wall02", and "Ceiling01" to give them a grimy, wet look as if they were mottled with patches of moss and stained by centuries of damp.
16. Drag "**Jailbench01**", a worn wooden bench, into the scene.
17. Resize "Jailbench01" to 1x2 meters. The countless scratches and etchings on its surface bear silent testament to the many previous inhabitants of the cell.
18. Position "Jailbench01" along one of the cell walls, allowing its stories to be whispered into the cold, stone facade.
19. Repeat steps 16 to 18 for "**Slab01**", a cold stone slab that serves as a bed, offering no comfort for Mabel.
20. In the "Material Editor", locate the "Scratches01" decal.
21. Apply "Scratches01" to various places on "Wall01" and "Wall02" to represent additional etchings and scratches of the prisoners, reflecting the passage of countless desolate days.
22. Locate assets "**Bone01, Bone02, Bone03**" in the "Asset Browser". These grim, weathered bones lying forgotten on the floor are a stark testament to the dungeon's dark past.
23. Drag and position these bone assets at various locations in the cell to convey the stark reality of the dungeon's previous inhabitants.
24. Find the asset "**Cage01**" in the "Asset Browser". This grim metal cage is suspended from the ceiling by rusted chains, its door hanging open in eerie invitation.
25. Drag "Cage01" into the scene.
26. Position "Cage01" in one corner of the cell, hanging ominously over the stone slab bed.
27. Locate "**Brazier**" in the "Asset Browser". The wrought-iron brazier filled with coals provides the only source of warmth and light in the dungeon.
28. Drag this asset into the scene and position it strategically to cast twisted shadows on the stone walls.
29. In the "Lighting" tab, drag a "Point Light" into the scene.
30. Position the "Point Light" near the "Brazier", and adjust the light color to a dim, fire-like hue.
31. Repeat step 30 for other lighting fixtures, adjusting the brightness and range to create an eerie atmosphere.
32. In the "Audio" tab, locate the sound file "BabyCry01".
33. Drag "BabyCry01" into the scene and set it to loop, enhancing the chilling atmosphere.
