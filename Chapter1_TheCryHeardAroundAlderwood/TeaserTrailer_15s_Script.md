FADE IN:

[SFX: HOWLING WINDS, DISTANT BABY CRYING, LOW DRONING STRINGS BUILDING INTO A CRESCENDO]

[VISUAL: Flash of BLACK SCREEN, sharp sound like a blade cutting the air, building tension.]

[SETTING: A haunting and gloomy COURTYARD, surrounded by ancient, moss-covered stone walls. Shadows dance as flickering torches cast an eerie glow. Crowds of fearful VILLAGERS gather, their faces pale and twisted, some weeping, some glaring with cold fury. A foreboding gallows, worn with time, stands as a dark and menacing centerpiece. CONSTABLE HARROW, a figure of authority, presides over the proceedings, his eyes like ice.]

[VISUAL: Flash of BLACK SCREEN, heartbeat sound effect.]

[VISUAL: Extreme Close Up (ECU) on CONSTABLE HARROW's unfeeling eyes, reflecting the torchlight. The ECU creates intense focus, revealing a soul hardened by judgment. Rack Focus to VILLAGERSâ€™ angry, desperate faces, eyes gleaming with a mixture of fear and hatred, illustrating the crowd's turbulent emotions.]

HARROW (Coldly): He dies for his crimes.

[VISUAL: Flash of BLACK SCREEN, echoing sound of a distant bell.]

[VISUAL: Close Up (CU) of JOHN's face, eyes bulging, sweat and tears mingling, under crushing stones. The CU emphasizes the terror and agony, his flesh marred by pain. Whip Pan to MABEL's horrified eyes, wide and shimmering with a mother's dread. Soft Focus on the dark, mossy stones and creeping vines of the courtyard, giving an otherworldly, nightmarish effect.]

MABEL (Whisper, English motherly accent): Mama's coming, Thomas...

[VISUAL: Flash of BLACK SCREEN, suspenseful music sting.]

[VISUAL: Mabel's POV, Low Angle Shot of baby THOMAS in a wrought iron cage, crying, suspended from an ancient, twisted tree gnarled with age. His small hands clutching the bars, making the baby seem tragically vulnerable. Dolly Zoom Shot out to show the height of the cage against the foreboding, overcast sky filled with crows or ravens, adding a sense of disorientation and isolation.]

[VISUAL: Medium Shot (MS) of MABEL, determination etched on her face, hurrying towards the cage, her cloak rustling on the wet cobblestone, reflecting the torches' flames. The MS emphasizes her fear and resolve, the shadows clinging to her form. Tracking Shot following her movement through the anxious crowd, faces contorted with superstition.]

HARROW (Shouting, Spotted MABEL): Get away from my child, Mabel! Witch! Get the witch!

[VISUAL: Flash of BLACK SCREEN, snarling sound effect.]

[VISUAL: Whip Pan Shot to ACCURSED creatures clawing at crumbling walls, their twisted forms bathed in shadow, teeth gleaming. The quick movement emphasizes primal terror. Cut to a Ground Level Shot of MABEL waking on a slab of wood in a mossy green dungeon cell, damp and rotting, chains hanging, water dripping, adding a chilling realism. Tracking Shot to a DAGGER gleaming ominously in an open doorway, a haunting glimmer in the dark.]

[SFX: ECHOING SCREAMS, HEARTBEAT POUNDING, STONES CRUSHING, CROWD SHOUTING, THOMAS CRYING FROM ANOTHER DUNGEON CELL]

FADE TO BLACK, Drone Shot ascending, offering a broad view of the bleak courtyard with its gothic architecture, and the surrounding village, suffocated by misty woods, emphasizing the oppressive, cursed environment, panning out to show just how big Alderwood actually is, even beyond the Forest.
