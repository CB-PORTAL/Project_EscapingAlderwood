# 3D Modeling Process

3D modeling can be thought of as a process involving multiple layers, with each layer adding more detail and complexity to the model.

## Layers of the 3D Modeling Process:

### 1. Mesh Structure (Base Layer)

The initial layout, including the primary shapes (cubes, prisms, etc.) that define the spaces within your model.

### 2. Detailed Mesh Modeling

Refinement of the mesh structure, adding more vertices to create more complex shapes and manipulating vertices to give surfaces a realistic, worn-out look.

### 3. UV Mapping

Unwrapping the mesh to apply 2D textures to it.

### 4. Texture and Material Application

Applying 2D textures to UV maps and adding materials that dictate how the surface interacts with light.

### 5. Rigging

Adding 'bones' to objects that need to move, which allows manipulation of a model's objects or vertices.

### 6. Animation

Animating the rigged objects to create movement.

### 7. Particle Systems

Creating environmental effects like dust or dripping water by simulating small pieces or volumes of matter.

### 8. Lighting and Shading

Adding lights to the scene and adjusting how materials look when light falls on them, which greatly affects the final look of the scene.

## Focus on each layer

Each layer is equally important and requires its own set of skills and attention to detail. The mesh structure serves as the foundation for everything else, but each stage directly affects the next, so a thorough approach to each layer is crucial.
