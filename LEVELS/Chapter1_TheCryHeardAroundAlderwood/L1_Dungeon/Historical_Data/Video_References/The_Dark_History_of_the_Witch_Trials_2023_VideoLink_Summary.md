## Key Points

- Witchcraft during this period was often linked with fertility potions, love charms, and malicious spells intended to bring about the demise of English kings.
- Society typically identified witches as elderly, impoverished women with distinctive physical traits such as a 'crone-like' appearance, snaggle-toothed grin, sunken cheeks, and a hairy lip â€“ features thought to indicate the possession of the 'Evil Eye'.
- Ownership of a cat by these women was considered undeniable proof of witchcraft, as it was commonly believed that witches always had a 'familiar', with cats being the most prevalent.
- Numerous women were unjustly convicted based on such evidence and were executed following horrific torture. Instruments such as 'pilnie-winks' (thumb screws) and iron 'caspie-claws' (fire-heated leg irons) were routinely used to coerce confessions.
