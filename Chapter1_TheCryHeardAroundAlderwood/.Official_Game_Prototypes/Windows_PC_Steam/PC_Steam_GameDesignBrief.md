# Game Design Brief
## Game Title:
"Chapter 1: The Cry Heard Around Alderwood - Escaping Alderwood"

## Game Type:
3D Horror Survival Adventure (Third-Person Perspective)

## Platform:
Steam (PC)

## Objective:
Embrace the role of Mabel, a mother accused of witchcraft in 16th-century Alderwood, England. These are the Objectives during Mabel’s quest to escape alderwood:

- **Rescue Thomas:** Begin your nightmare in The Dungeon Maze, where you must find your infant son, Thomas, without getting captured or killed by the patrolling guards. At the start of the level, Mabel wakes in her cell and sees a dagger in the open doorway threshold. You, as Mabel, can hear Thomas crying somewhere in the Alderwood Jail. The closer you get to finding Thomas, the louder he gets. Every once and a while, randomly, the guards will relocate Thomas into another dungeon cell, but you will always be able to gauge just how far away or how close Thomas is based on his cries. 

- **Escape the Maze:** Once united with Thomas, your next objective is to navigate through the maze dungeon and escape. It is worth noting that while you have Thomas, his crying will alert nearby enemies and cause them to speed up in her direction. Also, enemies cannot attack you while you have Thomas. They can only take Thomas away from you. Thomas acts as a shield because everyone in Alderwood has been ordered to not harm the baby and to bring him to Constable Harrow. Mabel can only get hurt or captured when she is attacked without Thomas in her arms, this is very important to add.

- **Courtyard Challenges:** Achieve two objectives in the courtyard by obtaining a key for Thomas's cage and a key for the gate, all while battling foes. So the keys that Mabel is looking for are hidden somewhere in the massive courtyard, it is possible that enemies are holding the keys; Mabel must find both keys, one is for her escape, the other is for freeing Thomas. 

- **Village Escape:** Traverse the village maze, avoiding hordes of villagers trying to return Thomas to Constable Harrow and recapture you. The villagers are after you, chasing you and you have to kill them or avoid them. Keep in mind, every NPC that you kill returns as The Accursed. The Accursed take one shot to kill, while many other enemies might take 2-5 hits to kill. Remember, no one can harm Mabel while she has Thomas in her arms. She only loses her shield if Thomas is taken by the villagers or if she does not yet have Thomas. It is worth noting that when the villagers take Thomas from Mabel, they are going to be programmed to take Thomas back toward the courtyard. If the villagers get too far with Thomas, she will lose the game, and remember, she can hide Thomas in Care Package Chests, but has to be careful because Thomas cries a lot throughout.

- **Forest Flight:** In the Alderwood Forest, the first objective is to seek safety for Thomas, so Mabel finds 2 chests - one chest is a Care Package, the other chest is a Curse Package. It is up to Mabel to decide which chest to hide Thomas; choose wrong and Thomas vanishes, concluding a failure to the level. Here’s the thing, Mabel must select one of the chests to hide Thomas due to her impending battle against Constable Harrow and the Nightcrows. So, Mabel hides Thomas, then the Raven swoops in to help her, the Raven can fight Constable Harrow through your commands. After defeating Constable Harrow, you must take Thomas out of the Chest. If you had previously put him in the wrong chest, you will not know this until after you had already defeated constable harrow. In that situation, if you accidentally chose the wrong chest and he went into the Curse Package, then Thomas will vanish, he will not be in the chest when you come back to get him out of there. Follow the Raven into the forest until you discover a cabin. In the cabin is Mabel’s mother (Need name of mother, supply a name for her mother). So now, what I am thinking is that Mabel’s mother is bound to a spell that has turned her into the Raven. The Raven, which is her mother, is helping Mabel throughout the course of the escaping alderwood journey. 

Along the way, encounter Care and Curse Packages resembling Chests, wield the Warden's Bow dropped by the Raven, and face the haunting transformation into the Accursed if you kill anyone. Your journey is filled with combat, stealth, puzzles, dread, lifelike characters, and AAA game title-quality graphics rendered with Unreal Engine.
